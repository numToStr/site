<h1>Hey 👋</h1>

I'm <strong>Vikas Rajbanshi</strong>, a Software Engineer based in India. I know how to code for the browser & server but I personally enjoy building stuff for the terminals.

Mostly self taught and never took any formal education related to Computer Science. Did my graduation in Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) from Delhi Universtiy and completed my High School education from Kendriya Vidhyalaya.

I love making tools and contributing to Open Source. My notable work are [Comment.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim), [FTerm.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/FTerm.nvim), [lemmy-help](https://github.com/numToStr/lemmy-help).

Thank you for visiting and be sure to check out my [**writings**](./posts)!
