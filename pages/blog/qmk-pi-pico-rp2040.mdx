import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Today, I planned to flash [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) on a Raspberry Pi Pico just to scratch my itch and see whether I could use Pi Pico for my next keyboard. To my surprise, it was fairly easy (or is it?).

Although, I did waste a couple of hours searching through [docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/platformdev_rp2040?id=raspberry-pi-rp2040), [existing firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/controllerworks/mini42/readme.md) on the qmk repository, understanding pin layout and bootloader mode. _It was enlightening but painful_. So here is everything that I learned so that you won't have to waste your time.

<Callout>For this particular setup, I am using 2x2 matrix with 1 encoder on each half and using `info.json` for most of the configuration for the configuration.</Callout>

### Basic Firmware

Run `qmk new-keyboard` command, which will give you the option to choose `RP2040` as the microcontroller and will have the required config pre-populated from the start. You will see the `processor` and `bootloader` with the following values:

```json filename="info.json"
{
    "processor": "RP2040",
    "bootloader": "rp2040"
}
```

These will tell QMK that you are making firmware for RP2040 or Pi Pico (in my case).

#### Pins

QMK suggests that you use `GPx` abbreviation to denote your pins, where `x` is the pin number. So here is the `matrix_pins` configuration for my test keyboard.

```json filename="info.json"
{
    "matrix_pins": {
        "rows": ["GP6", "GP7"],
        "cols": ["GP21", "GP20"]
    }
}
```

#### Layout

Here is my layout. I am not going to deep dive into configuring the layout, docs are your best friend.

```json filename="info.json"
{
    // above config...
    "layouts": {
        "LAYOUT": {
            "layout": [
                { "matrix": [0, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 1], "x": 1, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [2, 0], "x": 2, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [2, 1], "x": 3, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 1], "x": 1, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [3, 0], "x": 2, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [3, 1], "x": 3, "y": 0 },
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Rotary Encoders

I am using an EC11 rotary, which also comes with a push button (or switch) that we can hook into the switch matrix.

```json filename="info.json" {5}
{
    "encoder": {
        "enabled": true,
        "rotary": [
            { "pin_a": "GP10", "pin_b": "GP11", "resolution": 2 }
        ]

    }
}
```

For the rotary switch, I placed it on the second row and third column (pin: `GP19`). Thus, We need to update our `matrix_pins` config from before.

```json filename="info.json" {4} /GP19/
{
    "matrix_pins": {
        "rows": ["GP6", "GP7"],
        "cols": ["GP21", "GP20", "GP19"]
    }
}
```

And also updating our layout

```json filename="info.json" {8,11,14,17}
{
    // above config...
    "layouts": {
        "LAYOUT": {
            "layout": [
                { "matrix": [0, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 1], "x": 1, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 2], "x": 2, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [2, 0], "x": 3, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [2, 1], "x": 4, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [2, 2], "x": 5, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 1], "x": 1, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 2], "x": 2, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [3, 0], "x": 3, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [3, 1], "x": 4, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [3, 2], "x": 5, "y": 0 },
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Split Keyboard

Next up, setting up the 2 halves. This is no different than making a keyboard with any other microcontroller e.g., pro micro.

```json filename="info.json" {5} /soft_serial_pin/
{
    "split": {
        "enabled": true,
        "main": "left",
        "soft_serial_pin": "GP1",
        "transport": { "protocol": "serial" },
        "usb_detect": { "timeout": 2500 }
    },
}
```

The only thing to look out for is giving the correct pin number to `soft_serial_pin` as QMK only supports serial connection over [`SP0` or `PI0`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/platformdev_rp2040.md#raspberry-pi-rp2040) pins.

Also, if you have a different pin setup on the right half than the left half, then you need to configure `split.matrix_pins`.

```jsonc filename="info.json"
{
    "split": {
        // above config...
        "matrix_pins": {
            "right": {
                "rows": ["GP6", "GP7"],
                "cols": ["GP19","GP21", "GP20"]
            }
        },
    }
}
```

The same goes for the encoders if they are connected to different pins.

```jsonc filename="info.json"
{
    "split": {
        // above config...
        "encoder": {
            "enabled": true,
            "rotary": [
                { "pin_a": "GP11", "pin_b": "GP10", "resolution": 4 }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, but the most important thing is to specify the serial driver. Without this, the firmware won't compile and the errors are not that helpful.

```make filename="rules.mk"
SERIAL_DRIVER = vendor
```

### Keymaps

You can check out the keymaps (and full source) for this keyboard [here](https://github.com/numToStr/qmk_firmware/tree/picopad/keyboards/picopad).

### Bootloader and Flashing

<Callout>`qmk` cli is the only(?) way to flash the firmware, QMK toolbox is useless for RP2040</Callout>

Run `qmk flash -kb <keyboard> -km default{:bash}` to flash the firmware. QMK will compile the firmware into `uf2` file and then wait for the device...

To put Pi Pico into bootloader mode, connect the board while pressing the `BOOTSEL` button. You will see a storage device-connected notification, well I did. QMK will flash the firmware as soon as you try to open that storage drive.

> NOTE: If you have a new Pico, it might go to bootloader mode the moment you connect the board.

If everything goes right, you will have a Pi Pico Keyboard powered by QMK. Here is mine:
