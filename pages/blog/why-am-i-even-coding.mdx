I am commerce graduate but was not happy studying commerce. When I was a student I love science and tech stuff but was unable to make it through the science stream in my high school as my grades were not great.

But accidently I met a guy who was in coding stuff and suggest me to try it out. And this gets me as I am already unhappy with my studying.

From that day I started to learn coding and I can proudly say that I am a self taught coder.

Practically, I switched my career before even starting my career. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
